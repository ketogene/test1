# test1 Repo

This is a test repo.
The idea is to:
	=> (A) create a local respository 
	=> (B) create a remote 'test1' respository on github.com
	=> (C) push the local code to the remote respository
	=> (D) make local changes and update the remote copy
	=> (E) move to a new folder and pull the remote copy

The overall aim, of-course, is to become familiar with git/github

And maybe then start to use git/github in my own projects going forward.
(for example, for academic work)
